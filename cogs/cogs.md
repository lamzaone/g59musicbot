# info

- Files starting with "_" are usually for slash commands, the others are their prefix ("!" or whatever) alternative.

- If you want to disable any command cog, just rename the file and add an "!" in front of the name.
    - *eg: `_ping.py` -> `!_ping.py`*

- To load another command, just place the cog inside this folder.
